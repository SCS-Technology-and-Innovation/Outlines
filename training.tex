\paragraph{Sexual Violence Training {\em It Takes All of Us}}

In accordance with Qu√©bec law (Bill 151), all newly admitted
credit-course students must complete the sexual violence training
course, called ``It Takes All of Us,'' in myCourses during their first
semester at McGill. Students will receive an automated email letting
them know when they have been enrolled in the training course. Failure
to complete the training will restrict the student from registering
for courses in the following semester. The training can be accessed
through myCourses and will appear as a separate course in your
profile. For more information, please visit
