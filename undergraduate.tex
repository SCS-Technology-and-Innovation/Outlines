Although a D is a passing grade, it {\em will not permit entry} into a
subsequent course for which it is a prerequisite, and nor will it be
recognized if the course is a required course in your program. You
{\bf must} obtain a grade of C or better in courses that you take to
fulfil program requirements. You may not register in a course unless
you have passed all the prerequisite courses with a grade of C or
better, except by written permission of the appropriate department
chair.
