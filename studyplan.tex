\section*{Possible program transfers}

If you do not wish to complete the diploma, we recommend you to
consider the option of transferring to the newly created graduate
certificates as an option to completing the diploma. Please note that
whereas a single course could serve as a complementary course in more
than one certificate, you are only allowed to share one course between
two certificates. \textcolor{red}{revise the wording with Sue}
