Mercury course evaluations \url{https://www.mcgill.ca/mercury/} are
one of the ways that McGill works towards maintaining and improving
the quality of courses and the studentâ€™s learning experience. You will
be notified by e-mail when the evaluations are available. Please note
that a minimum number of responses must be received for results to be
available to students.
